# Leave Request and Approval Workflow Documentation

## Overview
This system implements a comprehensive leave request and approval workflow with multi-level approvals, delegation support, and business day calculations (excluding Friday and Saturday weekends).

## Workflow Features

### 1. **Automatic Business Day Calculation**
- Calculates business days automatically excluding Friday and Saturday
- No manual `days_count` input required
- Accurate leave balance validation based on business days

### 2. **Multi-Level Approval System**
- **Single-level approval**: For short leaves (≤3 days)
- **Multi-level approval**: For long leaves (>3 days) or specific leave types
- **Auto-approval**: For very short leaves based on designation settings

### 3. **Approval Level Determination**
- **Leave Duration**:
  - ≤3 days: Single level (reporting manager)
  - >7 days: 2 levels
  - >15 days or Maternity leave: 3 levels
- **Leave Types Requiring Multi-Level**: Maternity, Study leave
- **Employee Designation**: Senior levels always require multi-level approval

### 4. **Approval Chain**
- Follows employee reporting manager hierarchy
- Falls back to HR approvers if chain is insufficient
- Maximum 5 levels to prevent infinite loops

## Approval Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Short Leave (Auto-Approved)
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Employee**: Developer with auto-approve settings
- **Workflow**: Auto-approved, no manual approval needed

### Scenario 2: Single-Level Approval
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Employee**: Regular employee
- **Workflow**: Reporting Manager approval only

### Scenario 3: Multi-Level Approval
- **Duration**: 10 days
- **Employee**: Manager
- **Workflow**:
  1. Level 1: Direct Manager
  2. Level 2: Department Head

### Scenario 4: Delegated Approval
- **Duration**: 5 days
- **Manager**: On vacation with active delegation
- **Workflow**: Delegated approver handles approval

## Configuration Requirements

### Designation Settings
- `autoApproveLeaveDays`: Maximum days for auto-approval
- `canApproveLeave`: Whether employee can approve leaves
- `level`: Seniority level for approval requirements

### Employee Setup
- Reporting manager assignment
- Designation with proper settings
- Branch assignment for HR approver fallback

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **Insufficient Leave Balance**: Employee has insufficient leave days
- **Overlapping Leave**: Employee already has leave for same period
- **Unauthorized Approval**: Approver not in approval chain
- **Invalid Dates**: Start date after end date
- **Leave in Past**: Cannot create leave for past dates

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Insufficient annual leave balance",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

## Integration Points

### Attendance Integration
- Approved leaves automatically marked as "ON_LEAVE" in attendance
- Business day calculation ensures accurate attendance tracking

### Notification System
- Email notifications to approvers
- SMS notifications for urgent requests
- Dashboard alerts for pending approvals

### Payroll Integration
- Leave balance updates reflected in payroll calculations
- Leave encashment calculations based on business days

## Security Considerations

- Employees can only request their own leave (except HR/Admin)
- Approvers can only approve assigned requests
- Delegation requires explicit setup and activation
- All actions logged for audit trail
